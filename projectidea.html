								<h2><b>Project Idea</b></h2>
							</header>
							<p><b>Overview</b></p>
							<p style="font-family:verdana"><b>For the project my idea it is to develop an app for mobile phones that is useful for the users who are new to learning to program Python. The project will consist of the basic beginner tips on how to use Python with various images and definitions to the guide the users. With also test and quizzes for the vocabulary that is shown, the users can test their basic knowledge of the program language after learning it. This way those who like Python or create an interest for it through this app can go further in learning it through other websites and apps. As the app will also include links and recommendations of where the users can learn further Python.</b></p>

              <p><b>Motivation</b></p>
							<p style="font-family:verdana"><b>Right now in the world Python is most demanded programming language for IT companies, that is also easy to learn due to “Python rank[ing] as the third most loved programming language”, and the programming community have declared that “if Python can keep this pace, it will probably replace C and Java in 3 to 4 years’ time”. So those who choose to pursue and career in software engineering can be benefited by the app by finding a programming language that is easy to learn and can secure them a decent career if they choose to follow this path. Although the app is not going to make the users professionals in Python, it is an easy and free way to spark a passion inside them for learning the language.<b></p>
              <hr>
							<p><b>Description</b></p>
							<p style="font-family:Arial">As mentioned above the product will consist of the basic beginner steps on how to use Python through presenting various images and definitions to the guide the users on to attain the knowledge of the language in order to hopefully become better programmers. The app trains the users by also implementing tests which target the the users’ knowledge of what they learned with quizzes that consist of questions from the parts of python.</p>

<p>All of the previously mentioned uses will be embedded within the app in forms of various pages and tabs that include buttons to allow the users to easily navigate through it. Starting off with the home page features which will be broken into different categories of projects created with python, learning python and dictionary for python vocab. Once the users enter the learning section it will consist of even more buttons and categories that depict the various functions of the language. If the user wants to learn about the variables and datatypes, they can access that section with a click and find different variables in python with definitions and how to use them with description. After they have finished that sections they can go back to the variable and datatypes page.</p>

<p>The users can access all types of features another section is the operators section where the users can again click the section and it presents the various operators used in python such as addition, subtraction, modulus, or exponentiation. They are described with their definitions and their respected symbols in python with examples of them in use. Another feature in the learning section  is the loops section and similarly to the operators it presents the different loops however this section will only consist of 3 features as there are only three types of loops in python, so it will be easier to create this feature.</p>

<p>So, the learning feature is the bulk of the project where most of the information exists, but there are also other features that can be found in the homepage. Such as a section that presents the projects and apps created using python to show the users the benefits to learning python. As this section will include world renowned apps built using python such as Instagram, Pinterest and Reddit allowing the users to see the purpose of using this app.</p>

<p>Another feature of this app is the quizzes and tests section, where the users can test their knowledge the attained from the learning feature. When they feel like they are ready they can click the quizzes button and it opens a similar layout to the learning section with different features of python presented, however now each of these features contain simple questions and fill in the blanks for the various operators, variable etc. Once finishing one of the quizzes they can either do more or can go back the learning section in the app and come back to finish another quiz. This way the users are able to gain basic knowledge of the programming language step by step to familiarise themselves on how to create more extensive codes in the future using python.

              <p><b>Tools and Technology</b></p>
							<p style="font-family:verdana"><b> The funny thing about creating this project is that the material that is present and taught in the app is also used to make the app itself. As the software used to make this app will be python not only because it is easier to code with python to create a simple app, but also to show the users that they can also create an app with python just like the one they are using to learn it.  So basically, because I will be using python the equipment needed will be a functioning computer to code on and a mobile device to test it on after completion.</b></p>
							<hr>
							<p><b>Skills Required</b></p>
								<p style="font-family:verdana"><b> The skills require for this project is again knowing how to use python, as it is the foundation for creating this app. The whole software is going to be written in python, however if python does not work as a feasible language for the app, then an alternate will be used to make it. So, some skills on easy programming languages such as html or CSS is needed to complete the project. Learning these skills will not have an effect financially, but it will take time to learn them and make the project so overall it will a very feasible to find the skill required to create the project.</b></p>
								<hr>
								<p><b>Outcome<b></p>
								<p style="font-family:verdana"><b> If the project is successful then everyone who uses the app will acquire the knowledge of basic python language, hence can have a head start if they want to delve even deeper into the language. As previously mentioned too that this can mean those who choose to pursue a career in software engineering can be benefited by the app by finding a programming language that is easy to learn and can secure them a decent career if they choose to follow this path, instead of starting their journey into python from scratch, this project can aid in boosting their knowledge into the world of programming.</b></p>
